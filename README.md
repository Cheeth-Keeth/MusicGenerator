# musicGenerator
An LSTM for generating single instrument melodies

To Run This Code:

Clone the repo onto your desktop 

Then, open your favourite IDE (I use PyCharm) and open the project.

In the working directory, there will be a requirements.txt file which contains everything needed to be installed before
running the code. Run the following command:

$pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the app from the app.py file.

The flask application can then be opened on http://localhost:5000

If you scroll down to the bottom of the page a button labeled Generate should be available. Click this button to generate
a new song. This takes around 3 minutes.

After the song has been generated two new buttons should appear one for play and one for stop

To listen to the song click on the play button.

Enjoy!
